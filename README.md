## **Home Mortgage Approval Prediction Using Machine Learning Models**

### **Overview**

This project is part of the Machine Learning and Deep Learning (CDSCO2004E) course. The aim of the project is to predict home mortgage approvals using various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). 

The topic of this study is the prediction of U.S. home mortgage approvals using machine learning models. The problem formulation involves integrating previous loan approval decisions into the current process to enhance consistency and accuracy. The research question addresses which machine learning models can best predict loan approval decisions based on historical data. The concepts explored include feature importance, model interpretability, and the balance between model complexity and performance. The dataset used is the 2022 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data, and the main data analytics methods and tools are Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The most important results include Random Forest achieving the highest performance with an accuracy of 96.14% and valuable insights on feature importance for credit risk assessment. The conclusions and recommendations suggest that Random Forest is the most suitable model for this application due to its balance of performance, interpretability, and computational efficiency.
