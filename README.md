## **Home Mortgage Approval Prediction Using Machine Learning Models**

### **Overview**

This project is part of the Machine Learning and Deep Learning (CDSCO2004E) course. The aim of the project is to predict home mortgage approvals using various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The project explores the performance, interpretability, and computational efficiency of these models.

### **Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is the 2022 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data, which contains approximately 16.1 million rows and 99 features. Due to its large size, the dataset is not included directly in this repository. You can download the dataset from the following link:
